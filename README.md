# Explainable_Smoke_And_Fire_Detection_System
This is a project used for smoke and fire detection using tabular ML/DL methods and various YOLO nano models. Explainable AI is utilized as well to elaborate why the AI model took a particular decision for classification. In particular, there is a comparison of ML/DL methods and modern YOLO nano models [v8n, v10n, v11n and v12n] and an older version [v5n], to identify the best option for both cases, for lightweight purposes, to assist constrained and low-resource hardware/edge devices such as, mobile robots [UGVs, UAVs]. Then, the system makes use of Explainable AI [XAI] frameworks, like SHAP and LIME, for the reason to transform the AI models from black boxes to white boxes, thus to comprehend how and why they took a particular decision, which features contributed the most, offering better trust and confidentiality between them and humans/users/operators.
