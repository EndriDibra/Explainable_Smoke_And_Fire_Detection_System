# Explainable_Smoke_And_Fire_Detection_System
This is a project about a smoke and fire detection system using tabular ML/DL methods and various YOLO nano models. Explainable AI is utilized as well to elaborate why the AI model took a particular decision for classification. In particular, there is a comparison of ML/DL methods and modern YOLO nano models [v8n, v10n, v11n and v12n] and an older version [v5n], to identify the best option for both cases, for lightweight purposes, to assist constrained and low-resource hardware/edge devices such as, mobile robots [UGVs, UAVs] or base cameras to perform well without the need of expensive and advanced hardware PUs. Then, the system makes use of Explainable AI [XAI] frameworks, like SHAP and LIME, for the reason to transform the AI models from black boxes to white boxes, thus to comprehend how and why they took a particular decision, which features contributed the most, offering better trust and confidentiality, between them and humans/users/operators. Ultimately, there is a sensor fusion framework that incorporates the outputs from both the tabular and detection methods, in order to provide a more robust, effective and less prone to false-alarms smoke and fire system.
